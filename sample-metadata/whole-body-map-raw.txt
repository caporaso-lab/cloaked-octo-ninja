Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human nose metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:nostril	F33Nost	F33Nost	-105.2705456	ENVO:mucus	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:mucus	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Following quantitation, cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	M4	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human gut metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:feces	F22Fcsw	F22Fcsw	-105.2705456	ENVO:feces	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:feces	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly.

All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M14Knee	M14Knee	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction.

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M32Plml	M32Plml	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible.

All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F32Pinr	F32Pinr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human nose metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:nostril	M32Nstl	M32Nstl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:mucus	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves.

Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F21Fotl	F21Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours).

The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human oral metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:oral cavity	M11Tong	M11Tong	-105.2705456	ENVO:saliva	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:saliva	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis.

Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F13Knee	F13Knee	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:external auditory canal	M34Ewax	M34Ewax	-105.2705456	ENVO:ear wax	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:cerumen	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human oral metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:oral cavity	M41Mout	M41Mout	-105.2705456	ENVO:saliva	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:saliva	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M41Knel	M41Knel	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:external auditory canal	M12Ewxr	M12Ewxr	-105.2705456	ENVO:ear wax	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:cerumen	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F31Fotr	F31Fotr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F12Pinr	F12Pinr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F32Aptl	F32Aptl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	M6	Bacterial variation in human body habitats across space and time

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F22Pinr	F22Pinr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human oral metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:oral cavity	M44Tong	M44Tong	-105.2705456	ENVO:saliva	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:saliva	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M32Fotl	M32Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly.

Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F21Knel	F21Knel	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M32Knel	M32Knel	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F12Navl	F12Navl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours).

The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M33Frhd	M33Frhd	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis.

Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F11Plmr	F11Plmr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M22Fotr	M22Fotr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F12Indl	F12Indl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Forr	M11Forr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Plmr	M11Plmr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human urine metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:urine	M33Uric	M33Uric	-105.2705456	ENVO:urine	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:urine	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M42Knel	M42Knel	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human urine metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:urine	F13Urin	F13Urin	-105.2705456	ENVO:urine	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:urine	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M12Pinl	M12Pinl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M12Indr	M12Indr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Following quantitation, cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	F2	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human nose metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:nostril	M41Nstl	M41Nstl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:mucus	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals.

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human nose metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:nostril	F32Nstl	F32Nstl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:mucus	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected.

If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F21Fotr	F21Fotr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison).

Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human gut metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:feces	F12Fcsp	F12Fcsp	-105.2705456	ENVO:feces	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:feces	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:external auditory canal	M23Ewax	M23Ewax	-105.2705456	ENVO:ear wax	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:cerumen	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M22Plmr	M22Plmr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human urine metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:urine	F31Urin	F31Urin	-105.2705456	ENVO:urine	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:urine	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F32Frhd	F32Frhd	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M31Indl	M31Indl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:external auditory canal	F21Ewxl	F21Ewxl	-105.2705456	ENVO:ear wax	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:cerumen	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M43Fotl	M43Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human nose metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:nostril	M63Nost	M63Nost	-105.2705456	ENVO:mucus	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:mucus	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F21Plmr	F21Plmr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M31Glns	M31Glns	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M44Plmr	M44Plmr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human hair metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:hair	F32Hair	F32Hair	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:hair	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F14Plml	F14Plml	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours).

The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M33Knee	M33Knee	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis.

We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M12Knel	M12Knel	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human oral metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:oral cavity	M32Tong	M32Tong	-105.2705456	ENVO:saliva	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:saliva	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F24Plmr	F24Plmr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M53Fotr	M53Fotr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	60	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F34Fotl	F34Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human urine metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:urine	M14Urin	M14Urin	-105.2705456	ENVO:urine	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:urine	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human oral metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:oral cavity	M34Tong	M34Tong	-105.2705456	ENVO:saliva	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:saliva	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M41Pinl	M41Pinl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:external auditory canal	M13Ewax	M13Ewax	-105.2705456	ENVO:ear wax	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:cerumen	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F31Aptl	F31Aptl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M12Frhd	M12Frhd	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human gut metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:feces	F11Fcsw	F11Fcsw	-105.2705456	ENVO:feces	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:feces	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M42Aptl	M42Aptl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction.

We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M41Plml	M41Plml	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F21Indr	F21Indr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Frhd	M11Frhd	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected.

The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F22Knel	F22Knel	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison).

Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M63Knee	M63Knee	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months.

On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3).

Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:external auditory canal	F32Ewxl	F32Ewxl	-105.2705456	ENVO:ear wax	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:cerumen	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human oral metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:oral cavity	M42Tong	M42Tong	-105.2705456	ENVO:saliva	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:saliva	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human oral metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:oral cavity	M64Tong	M64Tong	-105.2705456	ENVO:saliva	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:saliva	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F24Fotl	F24Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M22Frhd	M22Frhd	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M34Fotr	M34Fotr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human oral metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:oral cavity	M31Tong	M31Tong	-105.2705456	ENVO:saliva	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:saliva	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human urine metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:urine	M63Uric	M63Uric	-105.2705456	ENVO:urine	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:urine	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	M3	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M13Fotr	M13Fotr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human hair metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:hair	M42Hair	M42Hair	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:hair	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M64Fotl	M64Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction.

We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F22Fotl	F22Fotl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F21Nose	F21Nose	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F22Kner	F22Kner	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected.

The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human urine metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:urine	M13Urin	M13Urin	-105.2705456	ENVO:urine	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:urine	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months.

On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison).

Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:external auditory canal	M42Ewxl	M42Ewxl	-105.2705456	ENVO:ear wax	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:cerumen	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F32Indl	F32Indl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M32Indr	M32Indr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human gut metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:feces	M21Fcsw	M21Fcsw	-105.2705456	ENVO:feces	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:feces	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M32Aptr	M32Aptr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F11Labi	F11Labi	-105.2705456	ENVO:mucus	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:mucus	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M22Glns	M22Glns	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M54Frhd	M54Frhd	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	60	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human hair metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:hair	F21Hair	F21Hair	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:hair	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human gut metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:feces	F21Fcsw	F21Fcsw	-105.2705456	ENVO:feces	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:feces	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F11Nose	F11Nose	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human gut metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:feces	M23Fcsw	M23Fcsw	-105.2705456	ENVO:feces	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:feces	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Following quantitation, cleaned amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios into a single tube. The final pool of DNA was precipitated on ice for 45 minutes following theaddition of 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	F2	Bacterial Community Variation in Human Body Habitats Across Space and Time

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M64Plmr	M64Plmr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals.

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period.

All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human gut metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:feces	M11Fcsp	M11Fcsp	-105.2705456	ENVO:feces	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:feces	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human gut metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:feces	M32Fcsw	M32Fcsw	-105.2705456	ENVO:feces	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:feces	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C.

Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M54Plmr	M54Plmr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	60	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours).

The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	F12Aptl	F12Aptl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sweat	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison).

Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Fotr	M11Fotr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human urine metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:urine	M43Uric	M43Uric	-105.2705456	ENVO:urine	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:urine	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:external auditory canal	F12Ewxl	F12Ewxl	-105.2705456	ENVO:ear wax	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:cerumen	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human nose metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:nostril	M12Nstl	M12Nstl	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:mucus	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human nose metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:nostril	F32Nstr	F32Nstr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:mucus	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human skin metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:skin	M11Pinr	M11Pinr	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:sebum	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human oral metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:oral cavity	F32Tong	F32Tong	-105.2705456	ENVO:saliva	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:saliva	32.5	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human hair metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:hair	F12Hair	F12Hair	-105.2705456	ENVO:sebum	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:hair	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:external auditory canal	M31Ewxr	M31Ewxr	-105.2705456	ENVO:ear wax	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:cerumen	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human gut metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:feces	M32Fcsp	M32Fcsp	-105.2705456	ENVO:feces	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:feces	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).

The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 x g for 40 minutes at 4C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 x g for 20 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air dried for 10 minutes at room temperature and then resuspended in 100 micro-l of nuclease-free water (MO BIO). The final concentration of the pooled DNA was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche).	40.0149856	costello_whole_body_sites	initial denaturation: 94; annealing: 50_0.5; elongation: 72_1.5; final elongation: 72_10; 35	F2	Bacterial variation in human body habitats across space and time

Volunteers were unrelated individuals of both sexes and most lived in Boulder, CO. Female subjects F1, F2, F3 and male subjects M1, M2, M3, M4, and M6 were 30-35 years old. Subject M5 was approximately 60 years old. The health status of the volunteers was self-reported. None of the volunteers indicated that they had been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0708.12). On the day of sampling, participants were instructed to bathe in the morning using their choice of personal hygiene products, but to avoid wearing deodorant or antiperspirant. The interval between subject bathing and the collection of most samples likely ranged from around several hours to half an hour. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking for one hour prior to oral sampling. Skin surfaces, hair on top of the head, and nostrils (nares) were sampled using autoclaved cotton-tipped swabs (Puritan) pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (S1, S2). Swabbing has been shown to be a suitable method for skin sample collection for microbial community analysis (S3). Dry cotton-tipped swabs were used to sample the external auditory canal [and earwax (cerumen) if present], the dorsal surface of the tongue, and stool. Stool samples have been shown to provide an adequately representative sample of the gut microbiota (S4). Stool was swabbed using two different methods for comparison: i) off of used bathroom tissue and ii) by stabbing the swab directly into the largest piece of feces (see Fig. S22 for comparison). We found that swabbing off of used bathroom tissue was adequate for obtaining material for microbial community analysis. Swabs were placed in sterile 15 ml plastic tubes and stored at -80C within 10 minutes of sampling. Volunteers sampled stool on the same days that the other samples were collected (within 24 hours). If needed, the subjects were provided dry ice for the transport of their stool samples back to the lab. Liquid samples were also collected. The oral cavity was rinsed by swishing 10 ml of sterile water for 10 seconds, and then spitting the water into a sterile 50 ml plastic tube (see Fig. S22 for comparison to dorsal tongue swabs). Liquids were stored at 4C for several hours before sterile filtration onto 0.2micro-m pore size cellulose-nitrate filters (Nalgene). Filtered samples were immediately placed at -80C. Volunteers sampled themselves while wearing sterile gloves after first having their palms and index fingers swabbed by another person wearing sterile gloves. Replicate samples from the right and left sides of the body were taken when possible. All but one subject had not taken antibiotics in the 6 months prior to the June sampling dates, and none took antibiotics during the study period. Figure S1 lists the sample types, dates, and subjects. Samples were stored at -80C for <1 week prior to DNA extraction. We performed a follow-up study aimed at addressing whether skin location influences bacterial community assembly. Our approach involved transplanting foreign bacteria from various donor sites (dorsal tongue, forehead, and volar forearm) onto disinfected recipient skin sites (forehead and volar forearm) both within and between individuals. All individuals were made aware of the nature of the experiment and gave written informed consent in accordance with the sampling protocol approved by the University of Colorado Human Research Committee (protocol 0109.23).	human urine metagenome	http://www.mobio.com/soil-dna-isolation/powersoil-dna-isolation-kit.html	UBERON:urine	M44Uric	M44Uric	-105.2705456	ENVO:urine	16S rRNA	ENVO:human-associated habitat	TCAG	UBERON:urine	None	CGS-GL	V2	0	PMID: 19892944	FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT	Amplicon DNA concentrations were determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen).
